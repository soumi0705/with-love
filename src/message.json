    "Next time I hug you, I probably won't let go for a long time.",
    "I can't decide if the best part of my day is waking up next to you, or going to sleep with you. Hurry home so I can compare the two again.",
    "Everyone has their own motivation to get up in the morning and face the day. You are mine.",
    "Whenever my phone vibrates, I hope you're the reason for it.",

    "Cuddling with you would be perfect right now ðŸ’‘",
    "If nothing lasts forever, can I be your nothing?",
    "You make my heart melt! ðŸ’•",
    "I couldn't ignore you even if I wanted to."
